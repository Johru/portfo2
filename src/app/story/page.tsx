<h3>Where I come from</h3>
      <p>How ironic are my teen years from today&apos;s perspective! When I was just 17, I spent entire weeks fiddling with websites. I taught myself basics of HTML and CSS and wrote them by hand in notepad. Back then, Javascript was something you disabled to prevent websites from pranking you. I wish someone had sat me down and explained to me how learning it could be a very viable career path. Sadly, I never quite realized that until 15 years later.</p>
      <p>Being told multiple times that it is too late to learn programming, I settled for a career in customer care, improving my communication skills, learning to work from a command line, and most importantly, receiving a steady stream of compliments for my good nature as a mentor. All the good vibes kept me in my position for far longer than they should have. Eventually though, I realized I long since hit a skill ceiling.
      </p>
      <p>Going forward, I had two choices. I could stay where I was and continue for the coming decades of my career doing the same thing every day and never learning anything of substance. Or I could take the leap of faith and move to a completely different industry, one where upskilling is as natural as breathing.</p>
      <p>For a short while, the negative effects of stagnation were evident. I am not built to stay in place for too long, my curiosity would smother me if I tried! Despite loving my  job as a mentor for years, I knew I had to find a path on which I would never run out of new challenges.</p>
