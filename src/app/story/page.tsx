      <p>How ironic are my teen years from today&apos;s perspective! When I was just 17, I spent entire weeks fiddling with websites. I taught myself basics of HTML and CSS and wrote them by hand in notepad. Back then, Javascript was something you disabled to prevent websites from pranking you. I wish someone had sat me down and explained to me how learning it could be a very viable career path. Sadly, I never quite realized that until 15 years later.</p>
