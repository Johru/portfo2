        <h2>Running up</h2>
        <p>
          How ironic are my teen years from today&apos;s perspective! When I was
          just 17, I spent entire weeks fiddling with websites. I taught myself
          basics of HTML and CSS and wrote them by hand in notepad. Back then,
          Javascript was something you disabled to prevent websites from
          pranking you. I wish someone had sat me down and explained to me how
          learning it could be a very viable career path. Sadly, I never quite
          realized that until 15 years later.
        </p>

        <p>
          Being told multiple times that it is too late to learn programming, I
          settled for a career in customer care, improving my communication
          skills, learning to work from a command line, and most importantly,
          receiving a steady stream of compliments for my good nature as a
          mentor. All the good vibes kept me in my position for far longer than
          they should have. Eventually though, I realized I long since hit a
          skill ceiling.
        </p>
        <p>
          Going forward, I had two choices. I could stay where I was and
          continue for the coming decades of my career doing the same thing
          every day and never learning anything of substance. Or I could take
          the leap of faith and move to a completely different industry, one
          where upskilling is as natural as breathing.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a short while, the negative effects of stagnation were evident. I
          am not built to stay in place for too long, my curiosity would smother
          me if I tried! Despite loving my job as a mentor for years, I knew I
          had to find a path on which I would never run out of new challenges.
        </p>
        <h2>Taking the Leap</h2>
        <p>
          At just the right moment, some of my work paid off. My second attempt
          at building an application for tax calculation was accepted. My first
          try was bloated, buggy, and really hard for users to understand. The
          second was clean, simple, stable (at the cost of slightly reduced
          scope) and came with solid documentation explaining every numbered
          section of the app. As a result, the tool was officially endorsed by
          my company and recommended as he go-to tool to calculate tax
          differences in production across the reservations department.
        </p>
        <p>
          All this of course was with no programming skills, using just MS Excel
          in my free time, completely unpaid. What then, I asked myself, could I
          eventually build with the full might and power of an actual
          programming language?
        </p>
        <p>
          To see where that road might lead, I left my job to join a fullstack
          course at Green Fox Academy. Started from scratch with basics of
          javascript, through many project and exams, all the way to the final
          app we built as a team of students. I had the opportunity to work on
          both the frontend and backend of an Angular app, build authorization
          and authentication, and got my first pull requests rejected because of
          tiny pedantic details I soon learned are more important than they
          sound.
        </p>
        <p>
          And here I am now, eager for an opportunity to gain proper and full
          commercial experience in the field, yet unsure where to go on the ever
          shifting market and how to finally get my foot in the door. One thing
          is for sure though. I will never stop learning and exploring. Like a
          shark in the water, I can&apos;t ever stop moving!

        <h3>TLDR</h3>
        <p>
          If reading lengthy stories doesn&apos;t quite fit in your day, lets
          summarize:
        </p>
        <p>
          I couldn&apos;t bear the thought of not learning anything new anymore
          and getting too comfortable. Thus I decided to switch fields to
          software developent. My aim is to constantly learn, grow and keep a
          finger on the pulse of modern development. I will probably never
          settle for an easy corporate chair and stop pushing the boundaries.
